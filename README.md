# Useful-dpy-scripts
A bunch of useful code snippets which you can use for your discord bot coded in dpy
<p> In this repository I published some commands which I made for my own bot (Coral). </p>
<p> When using them make sure you give me credit (https://github.com/evo0616lution). </p>
<u> This additional packages are needed: </u>
```
discord
requests
asyncio
discord-py-slash-command
postbin
```
<p> You can install them using pip. </p>
<u> This are the imports for the code: </u>
```
import discord
import asyncio
import os
import time
import json
from discord.ext import commands
from discord.utils import get
from discord.utils import find
from typing import Optional
from discord import TextChannel
import postbin
import yaml
import secrets
import random, string
from discord import Embed
from datetime import date
from datetime import datetime
from discord.ext import tasks
import requests
from discord_slash.utils import manage_components
from discord_slash.model import ButtonStyle
from discord_slash.utils.manage_components import create_button, create_actionrow
from discord_slash.utils.manage_components import wait_for_component
from discord_slash import SlashCommand
from discord_slash import ComponentContext
from discord_slash.utils.manage_commands import create_option
from discord_slash.utils.manage_components import create_select, create_select_option

Some of them are not needed. Please import them anyway (Just to make sure it works)

Use the snippets wisely, have fun with coding :D
